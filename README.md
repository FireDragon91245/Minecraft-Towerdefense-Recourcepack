# Minecraft-Towerdefense-Recourcepack
Rhis is the other part to the towerdefense datapack, this part is just for the looks and dosnt add any new mechanics. This contains custom models and textures for the datapck towers.

# Compatibilety
- compatible with optifine and forge.
- compatible with minecraft 1.16.x but shoult also be compatible with newer version altough this will give a warning in the recourcepack selection screen.
- should be compatible with other performence mods on fabric and forge, if there are visual bugs first disable the mods before reporting.

# Important
The version of the datapack and the recourcepack MUST be the same to work properly.
